            Waterway Labs are an expanding tech company with a focus on real world events to introduce people to the Internet Computer blockchain. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Like most successful brands, we too have our niche. We use narrowboats, something most people we have met love, to bring a unique excitement to each one of our products.

            <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> will be no different, we are creating a floating mini golf course, to be used for promotional events throughout the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
            We plan to moor our floating <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD MINIPUTT</span> course near some of the best golf courses in the world, in the heart of Surrey in the United Kingdom.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will use our unique setup to provide entertaining golf gamification to real world users. Content will be recorded and added to the range of Waterway Labs social media channels.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the largest anticipated user base for <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> being in the US, we plan to focus on signing up courses as soon as possible through reverse promotion. 
            We will approach a course and ask to become the featured course for a day, adding them to the platform whilst showcasing their course in the best way possible.
