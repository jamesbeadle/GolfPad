    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span>, will carry this philosophy to new heights. We are bringing the ultimate combination of fun, technology, and community to life by creating a floating mini-golf course that will be used for promotional events across the UK. This innovative concept will allow golf enthusiasts and casual players alike to enjoy a new way to play and connect with others.

    To ensure maximum exposure, we will anchor our floating <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD MINI-PUTT</span> course near some of the world’s most renowned golf courses, with our debut location nestled in the heart of Surrey, one of the UK’s premier golfing regions. By mooring our course at these prestigious sites, we’ll introduce our unique gamified golf experience to both seasoned players and curious newcomers. We’re not just creating another mini-golf course—we’re creating a destination for fun, entertainment, and social connection.

    Our goal is to seamlessly merge the real-world excitement of golf with the power of social media and digital engagement, positioning <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> at the center of an already competitive and passionate golfing community. With an eye on growth, we’re strategically building a strong online presence, engaging with influencers, and promoting our events to connect with a broader audience.
