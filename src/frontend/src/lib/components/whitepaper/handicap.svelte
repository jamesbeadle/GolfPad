  <p>
    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> plans to revolutionise the golfing world with a groundbreaking handicap system that leverages decentralised technology and community governance. 
    Our vision is to become the global authority on golf handicapping by addressing the inherent weaknesses of the current system, 
    which is dominated by siloed and centralised entities.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-black condensed mt-4">Eliminating Barriers in Handicap Calculation</h2>
  <p>
    The traditional handicap system is fraught with complexities and restrictions, especially when golfers attempt to play internationally. 
    National handicap authorities often impose limitations that prevent handicaps from being recognised across borders. This fragmentation not only hinders the global golfing community but also restricts players from enjoying a seamless experience.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span>'s new handicap system removes these obstacles by utilising a decentralised platform where all golfers can store their rounds and compete worldwide. By eliminating middlemen, 
    we provide a unified and accessible system that recognises handicaps globally, creating a more inclusive golfing environment.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-black condensed mt-4">Free and Accessible Handicap Data</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that a golfer's handicap should be freely available to all who enjoy the game, 
    not just those who pay membership fees to specific jurisdictional authorities. 
    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> democratises access to handicap data, ensuring that every golfer, regardless of affiliation or financial commitment, 
    can participate fully in the sport they love.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-black condensed mt-4">Enhanced Accuracy with Real-Time Data
  </h2>
  <p>
    One of the major flaws in the current handicap calculation is the reliance on outdated slope ratings, which are typically updated every ten years. 
    This archaic system fails to account for real-time changes in course difficulty due to factors like weather conditions or course modifications.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> addresses this issue by calculating a course's difficulty in real-time based on actual player performance data. 
    By harnessing big data and on-chain algorithms managed by a community of co-owner golfers, 
    we provide a more accurate and fair handicap system. 
    This approach not only enhances competitiveness but also increases enjoyment for golfers of all levels.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-black condensed mt-4">Mathematical Proof of Superior Accuracy
  </h2>
  <p>
    We are confident that our handicap calculation algorithm offers superior accuracy compared to existing systems. 
    By analysing the spread of scores from the expected handicap-adjusted outcomes, 
    we aim to demonstrate mathematically that our system produces a smaller variance. 
    This level of precision leads to more competitive rounds and a better overall experience for players.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-black condensed mt-4">Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span>'s new handicap system represents a significant step forward in making golf more accessible, fair, and enjoyable. 
    By eliminating unnecessary barriers and leveraging cutting-edge technology, 
    we are creating a unified platform that benefits golfers worldwide. 
    We invite you to join us in this exciting venture to redefine the future of golf.
