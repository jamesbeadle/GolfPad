    <h1 class="text-xl condensed">The GolfPad DAO</h1>
    
    <p>
        The <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> DAO will be used to govern our valuable worldwide golf dataset. 
        As a new golfer discovers the platform and adds their home course, a proposal can be raised to make their course official. 
        This consensus backed dataset of worldwide courses will serve as the foundation for a range of Golf apps within the <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DAO will be decentralised and governed using the utility token, $GOLF. The $GOLF token will be used throughout the <span class="condensed">GOLFPAD</span> ecosystem, initially ensuring we have zero 3rd party dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future features will enable golfers, coaches and clubs to use their golf tokens as we bring additional areas of golf 100% on-chain.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will enable coaches to provide lessons and subscription based content through our upcoming <span class="condensed">GOLF SCHOOL</span> features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Golf clubs will have the opportunity to manage memberships, events and take payments all on a completely secure, tamper-proof blockchain.
