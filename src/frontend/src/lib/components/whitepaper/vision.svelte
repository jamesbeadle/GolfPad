    Many people who love golf can be inconsistent golfers, it's a game that usually requires a lot of practice. 
    Central to <span class="font-extrabold text-black condensed">GOLFPAD</span> are our initial 4 new golf game formats, designed to expand on the individual achievements of your round.  
    Whether a beginner or advanced golfer, everything we build has been designed to help you enjoy becoming a better golfer.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are starting with new games but we plan to make <span class="font-extrabold text-black condensed">GOLFPAD</span> 
    the home of everything golf from playing to coaching. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="font-extrabold text-black condensed">GOLFPAD</span> will operate as a DAO, 
    owning and managing the worldwide dataset of golf courses. It will use this 100% on-chain data as a foundation to deliver a range of golf related features and applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="font-extrabold text-black condensed">GOLFPAD</span> will provide golfers and golf clubs with a range of tools, initially launching with Yardage Sets.
     This useful feature will allow golfers to keep track of how far they hit each club, saving multiple sets for the yardages you hit in different environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    We aim to make <span class="font-extrabold text-black condensed">GOLFPAD</span> the home of community golf.
