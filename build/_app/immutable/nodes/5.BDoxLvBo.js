It’s a game that rewards tactical thinking, careful decision-making, and the ability to bounce back from mistakes—perfect for golfers looking to shake up their usual match play routine.</p> <p class="relative">In <span class="condensed">MULLIGANS</span>, both players automatically receive a mulligan every three holes, starting with the 1st hole and continuing on the 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th. These "do-over" shots can be used at any time, giving golfers the opportunity to replay a wayward drive, take another approach shot, or try again on the greens—all with the aim of staying competitive in the match.</p> <p class="relative">But here’s where the strategy deepens: golfers also compete to earn additional mulligans by winning a hole. Each hole becomes a battle not just for the lead but for valuable resources that can change the tide of the game. Will you save your mulligan for a critical moment later in the round, or use it now to put pressure on your opponent?</p> <p class="relative">The key to <span class="condensed">MULLIGANS</span> lies in how you play them. A well-timed mulligan can help secure a win on a tough hole or stop your opponent from running away with the match. Every decision becomes part of the strategy, keeping the competition fresh, engaging, and unpredictable from start to finish.</p> <p class="relative">With <span class="condensed">MULLIGANS</span>, golfers can enjoy their round with a little less pressure, knowing that a few mistakes are not just allowed—they’re part of the fun. It’s a format that brings out the competitive spirit while encouraging players to laugh off the occasional misstep, making it perfect for friendly matches or lively rivalries.</p> <p class="relative">Whether you’re a seasoned golfer or a casual player, <span class="condensed">MULLIGANS</span> offers a new way to enjoy the game, combining tradition with innovation for a round that’s as entertaining as it is strategic.</p></div></div>');function pt(t){let e=k(!1),s=k(0),a=[{src:"whitepaper/mulligans1.jpg",alt:"In-game view",nextLabel:"Show Results View"},{src:"whitepaper/mulligans2.jpg",alt:"Results screen",nextLabel:"Show In-game View"}];async function o(){y(s,(n(s)+1)%a.length)}W(t,{get showModal(){return n(e)},onClose:()=>{y(e,!1)},children:(c,m)=>{var d=dt(),i=h(d),r=h(i),l=g(r,2),w=h(l,!0);p(l),p(i),Y(2),p(d),O(()=>{R(r,"src",a[n(s)].src),R(r,"alt",a[n(s)].alt),z(w,a[n(s)].nextLabel)}),A("click",l,o),L(c,d)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}var ut=M('<div class="flex flex-col px-2 py-4 space-y-4 md:flex-row md:items-start md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0"><div class="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 md:items-start md:w-1/3"><img class="object-cover w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"> <button class="w-full brand-button"> </button></div> <div class="flex flex-col space-y-2 text-xl leading-relaxed md:w-2/3"><p class="relative"><span class="condensed">NEXT UP</span> is a dynamic and competitive new game format that puts a spotlight on performing under pressure, especially when it’s your turn to go first off the tee. It’s all about stepping up when it matters most, defending your assigned holes, and seizing opportunities to gain an edge over your opponents.</p> <p class="relative">Here’s how it works: Each hole is a chance to earn points. A golfer earns 3 points for successfully defending a hole when they’re first off the tee, while their opponent can earn 1 point if they manage to beat the defender. The game keeps things fair and exciting by randomising who tees off first across the round, ensuring everyone gets their share of opportunities to defend.</p> <p class="relative">But that’s not all—<span class="condensed">NEXT UP</span> has a clever comeback mechanic. Any remaining unassigned holes are given to the golfer with the lowest score at the time of tee-off. This creates a unique opportunity for the trailing player to defend the hole, potentially swinging momentum back in their favor and leveling the playing field.</p> <p class="relative">The genius of <span class="condensed">NEXT UP</span> lies in its focus on pressure situations. By training golfers to perform when they’re first off the tee, this format sharpens your ability to stay composed, deliver clutch drives, and take control of the hole from the very start.</p> <p class="relative">Whether you’re playing with friends or looking to refine your skills under competition-like conditions, <span class="condensed">NEXT UP</span> keeps every round fresh, engaging, and full of strategic decisions.
