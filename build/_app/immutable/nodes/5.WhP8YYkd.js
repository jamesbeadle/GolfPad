A golfer earns 3 points for successfully defending a hole when they’re first off the tee, while their opponent can earn 1 point if they manage to beat the defender. The game keeps things fair and exciting by randomising who tees off first across the round, ensuring everyone gets their share of opportunities to defend.</p> <p class="relative">But that’s not all—<span class="condensed">NEXT UP</span> has a clever comeback mechanic. Any remaining unassigned holes are given to the golfer with the lowest score at the time of tee-off.
